Description: A tool for analyzing VCF files based on multipe sequenced
    baculovirus isolates mapped to a common reference sequence. Specifities of 
    single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) sites to a certain isolate or multiple isolates
    are determined and relative frequencies of alternative nucleotides are analyzed.
